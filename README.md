# Bass Guitar (more later) Transcription Project Goals and Phases

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing a transcription system specifically for the bass guitar. Using the Raspberry Pi 5, the Hailo 26 TOPS AI HAT, and a Boss Katana 110 Bass amplifier, the system will process audio data captured via a Rocksmith cable to generate sheet music and tablature. The goal is to create an efficient, real-time solution tailored to bass guitarists, leveraging edge AI capabilities for accurate transcription.

## **Project Goals**

### **Key Features**
- **Bass-Specific Transcription**: Build and fine-tune AI models optimized for bass guitar frequencies and playing styles.
- **Audio-Only Pipeline**: Focus on high-quality audio capture using the Rocksmith cable connected to the Boss Katana 110 Bass amp.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Develop low-latency transcription workflows for live or practice scenarios.
- **Output Formats**: Generate bass tablature and sheet music in standard formats such as MusicXML, PDF, or plain text tabs.

## **Phased Development Plan**

### **Phase 1: Audio Transcription Pipeline**
- Set up the Raspberry Pi 5 and Hailo AI HAT for AI inference.
- Configure audio input using the Rocksmith cable connected to the Boss Katana 110 Bass amp.
- Implement a basic transcription pipeline to process bass guitar audio and generate tablature or sheet music.

### **Phase 2: Model Optimization for Bass Guitar**
- Fine-tune pre-trained transcription models (e.g., MT3 or similar) specifically for bass guitar frequencies and techniques (e.g., slap, fingerstyle, pick).
- Train on custom datasets of bass recordings to improve accuracy.

### **Phase 3: Real-Time Processing**
- Optimize the transcription pipeline for real-time performance using the Hailo accelerator.
- Minimize latency for live practice or performance scenarios.

### **Phase 4: Output Formatting**
- Develop tools to convert transcription outputs into standard formats such as:
  - Plain text tablature
  - MusicXML (for use in notation software)
  - PDF (for printable sheet music)
- Add options to customize output formats (e.g., note duration, tempo markings).

### **Phase 5: User Interface Development**
- Create a simple interface for musicians to interact with the system.
- Include features such as:
  - Start/stop recording
  - Adjusting model sensitivity
  - Exporting transcriptions in various formats

## **Future Goals**
- Expand functionality to include advanced bass techniques like harmonics and tapping.
- Incorporate multi-track transcription for ensemble performances.
- Explore integration with music education tools, such as interactive lessons or feedback systems.
